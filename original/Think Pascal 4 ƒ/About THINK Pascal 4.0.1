About THINK Pascal 4.0.1=======================Copyright © 1992 Symantec Corporation. All rights reserved.January 9, 1992Font: Geneva 12INTRODUCTION=============THINK Pascal 4.0.1 corrects some problems with debugging programs on a Macintosh Quadra and corrects some other problems in THINK Pascal 4.0. It also contains a new version of SANE.p that corrects some of its interfaces and contains new versions of Runtime.Lib, TCLRuntime.Lib, and MARuntime.Lib that you can use in a project you’re profiling.   This document has three more sections:    •  UPDATING THINK PASCAL tells you how to run         “THINK Pascal -> 4.0.1” and “Misc Updates.sea” to update          your copy of THINK Pascal.	    •  WHAT THIS UPDATE FIXES lists the most important bugs that         this update fixes.    •  LAST MINUTE CHANGES lists some last minute changes and         corrections to the THINK Pascal User Manual. This section         contains much of the information in the READ ME file on your         THINK Pascal 4.0 disk, in addition to some more recent         information. UPDATING THINK PASCAL=======================This update transforms your existing THINK Pascal 4.0 application to THINK Pascal 4.0.1. You will run the patch program “THINK Pascal => 4.0.1” and then replace some runtime libraries.    1. Make sure that you have your original THINK Pascal        application. You won't need it for this update, but you         should make sure that you have a backup in case the         update fails. Do not patch your original master disk.    ••••    NOTE    ••••        Do not patch your original master disk. If you have         problems installing or using this patch, you’ll need it.    2. Double-click on the patch program "THINK Pascal -> 4.0.1"         to launch it. Click on the Update THINK Pascal button to         continue.    3. Find your existing copy of THINK Pascal in your THINK         Pascal Folder. Select it and click on the Patch button.    4. If the patch was successful, you'll get a confirmation.        5. Double-click on the program “Misc Updates.sea.” to launch it.        6. A standard file dialog appears. Move to your Development folder          and click Extract.            7. The archive decompresses its files and places them on your hard          disk. It displays its progress in a dialog. The archive quits         when it’s done.            8. The next time you open a project, THINK Pascal asks if you want         to convert the project, overwriting the existing version. Click        Yes.WHAT THIS UPDATE FIXES=======================THINK Pascal 4.0.1 is a minor upgrade to THINK Pascal 4.0 that lets you use THINK Pascal on a Macintosh Quadra and fixes some bugs. MiscUpdates.sea replaces these files:    •  Project Utilties in your THINK Pascal 4.0.1 Folder    •  Runtime.Lib in your THINK Pascal 4.0.1 Folder    •  TCLRuntime.Lib in your Libraries folder    •  MARuntime.Lib in your Libraries folder    •  µRuntime.Lib in your Libraries folder    •  SANE.p in your Interfaces folder The rest of this section describes the most significant bugs that THINK C 4.0.1 fixes:• The new versions of Runtime.Lib, TCLRuntime.Lib, MARuntime.Lib, and    µRuntime.Lid let you reset a program that you are profiling.	• Project Utilities works correctly when you choose Back Up.• SANE.p has all correct function interfaces.• Multi-segment code resources and drivers that move in memory after   loading or unloading a segment work correctly.      • When running in 32-bit mode, the LightsBug heap display is correct.         • When you use Undo, Cut, or Paste to edit source code for a program while    it’s running, THINK Pascal displays an alert and doesn’t perform the edit if    you click No.   • Tabs always look the same on the screen and printed copy.   • The Command-key equivalent for Entire Document in the Save As...   dialog is now Command-E and doesn’t conflict with the command-key    equivalent for the Desktop button.   • Printing the Text window in draft mode on an ImageWriter works   correctly.   • THINK Pascal generates correct code  for all assignment statements    with a short-circuit Boolean expression on the right-hand side.   • THINK Pascal is now compatible with the breakpointing scheme used    in recent versions of MacsBug.      • On a Macintosh Quadra, you can now call _MaxApplZone while running in    the THINK Pascal environment. • Your project can contain more than 127 segments.	• THINK Pascal correctly places a stop sign in your file after it displays   an alert.• The Use Second Screen option works correctly even if the main screen    isn’t the first device in the device list.• The “Custom Header” option for code resources works correctly.LAST MINUTE CHANGES====================•  This disk contains the file “Installing THINK Pascal,” which tells you how    to set up THINK Pascal on your hard drive. It duplicates Chapter 2,     “Installing THINK Pascal,” in the THINK Pascal User Manual. It’s included     on disk so the people who never read manuals can read it. If the document     contradicts anything in the manual, follow the document. The differences     may reflect minor changes in the layout of the disks.    Editing-------• The Clean Up Windows command described on page 78 is not in THINK   Pascal 4.0.Using Predefined Routines------------------------•  The declaration for the routine DeviceLoop that’s built into THINK Pascal     is incorrect.  To use the routine, be sure to include this declaration in any    file that calls it:            PROCEDURE DeviceLoop( drawingRgn: RgnHandle;            drawingProc: DeviceLoopDrawingProcPtr;            userData: LongInt; flags: LongInt );        INLINE $ABCA;•  On page 142, the list of built-in interfaces is incorrect. These files are     NOT built into THINK Pascal:        MacPrint.p		MemTypes.p			OSIntf.p    PackIntf.p		PaletteMgr.p		PickerIntf.p    QDOffscreen.p	SCSIIntf.p			ToolIntf.p    VideoIntf.p        QDOffscreen.p is included with THINK Pascal. You can use its functions    if you include the file in your project and in your uses statment. The     others are not included in THINK Pascal because they duplicate other     interfaces or because they are no longer used.•  On pages 142 and 143, Sounds.p is in both lists of interfaces: those that     are built-in and those that aren’t. There are in fact two versions of     Sounds.p. The interfaces are for the Source Manager routines in Inside    Macintosh V and VI are NOT built-in. You can use the functions if you     include the file in your project and your uses statment The interfaces for    the Sound Manager routines in Inside Macintosh I to VI are built-in.                LightsBug---------•  LightsBug does not display the correct values of these fields of a     WindowRecord: windowPic, visRgn, and clipRgn. To see their correct     values, use the Observe window. THINK Pascal Menus------------------•  On page 239, the first sentence in the Far Code option’s description    should read:            If this option is on, THINK Pascal lets you write large        applications: applications with a jump table as large as 256K. Using MacApp-------------•  You MUST use MacApp 2.0.1 or 2.0.2, and you MUST discard your current     THINK MacApp folder and convert your MacApp sources again with the     materials supplied with THINK Pascal 4.0. For more information, see    the Object-Oriented Programming manual, Appendix A, “MacApp and    THINK Pascal.”•  The “MacApp 2.0 for THINK Pascal 4.0” folder contains special versions     of the UFailure library in the “Special Failure Handlers” folder. Use these     libraries if you’re running a MacApp project under THINK Pascal, and you     need to debug your failure-handling routines. For more information, see     the file “Using the Special Failure Handlers” in the “Special Failure     Handlers” folder.•  The MacApp failure-handling routines do not work in programs running    under the THINK Pascal environment. THINK Pascal may crash if your    program invokes the failure chain. You can conditionally compile the    routine Failure in UFailure.p so that it halts your program and issues    a message, instead of invoking the failure chain.Using Launching Utilities with THINK Pascal----------------------------------------Don’t use utilities that launch other applications, like ICOM’s OnCue or NowSoftware’s MultiMaster, while you are running an application in the THINKPascal environment.Using SetupA4 and RestoreA4---------------------------If you write multi-segment drivers, desk accessories, or code resources,make sure that any routine that needs to call SetupA4 and RestoreA4 is inthe same segment as RSRCRuntime.Lib or DRVRRuntime.Lib. Using Object Pascal in Multi-Segement Code Resources--------------------------------------------------If you're using THINK Pascal 4.0 to write code resources with Object Pascal, there are some important details that you should note:     1. In the By Segment view of the Project Window, the <<%_SelProcs>> and          <<%_MethTables>> entries should be together in a different segment          than the main program.     2. In the file that contains Main, insert the following code before the         main procedure:          {$S %_MethTables}          {$Push}          {$N-}          procedure LoadMethTables;          begin          end;          {$Pop}          {$S}     3. The beginning of your Main procedure should look something like this:          procedure Main {any optional arguments};          begin               RememberA4;               SetupA4;               LoadMethTables;               {     rest of Main's code     }                    RestoreA4;          end;The important thing here is that you must call LoadMethTables (a routinein the %_MethTables segment), before you use any object-related routines (including New). Otherwise, objects won’t work.
