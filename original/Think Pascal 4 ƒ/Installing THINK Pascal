If you’re installing THINK Pascal for the first time, be sure to read the whole document. If you need to restore a few things from the original disks, read “What’s in the Archives” later in this document.      ••••••••••      IMPORTANT:      ••••••••••            You must have a hard drive to use THINK Pascal 4.0.            This document duplicates Chapter 2, “Installing THINK Pascal,” in the THINK Pascal User Manual. It‘s included on disk so the people who never read manuals can read it. If this document contradicts anything in the manual, follow this document. The differences may reflect minor changes in the layout of the disks.Your THINK Pascal 4.0 disks contain a total of seven self-extracting archives, applications that contain compressed files which they decompress and install on your hard disk. You’ll create a folder on your hard drive and then run each self-extracting archive and let them install their files in that folder. Then you’ll move the THINK Pascal 4.0 application into the newly created THINK Pascal 4.0 Folder. BEFORE YOU START=================Before you install THINK Pascal 4.0, you’ll want to take care of these steps:      •  Read the READ ME file on the disk THINK Pascal 1.       •  Make a copy of your THINK Pascal 4.0 disks.      •  Fill out and send in your registration card.       •  Make sure you have at least 5.75 megabytes (5.75MB) of disk space           free.       •  Turn off any anti-viral software, like Symantec AntiVirus for the          Macintosh (SAM).          INSTRUCTIONS==============Here’s how to install THINK Pascal 4.0:1.  In the Finder, create a new folder and name it Development.      2.  Insert the disk THINK Pascal 1, and double-click on “THINK Pascal      Utilities.sea”.3.  A standard file dialog, like the one below, appears. Move to your      Development folder and click Extract. 4.  The archive decompresses its files and places them on your hard disk. It      displays its progress in the dialog below. The archive quits when it’s     done. 5.  Repeat steps 2–4 for the each of the other archives on THINK Pascal 2,      THINK Pascal 3, and THINK Pascal 4.6.  Insert THINK Pascal 1, and move THINK Pascal 4.0 into the      THINK Pascal 4.0 Folder in your Development folder.When you’re done, the Development folder contains these folders, as shown  below:      •  THINK Pascal 4.0 Folder      •  Pascal 4.0 Utilities      •  THINK Pascal 4.0 Demos      •  TCL 1.1 Demos      •  MacApp 2.0 for THINK Pascal 4.0       ••••••••••      IMPORTANT:      ••••••••••            The icons in your folders won’t be in the same places as the icons             in this illustration. You can arrange them anyway you want inside             the folder. WHAT’S IN THE ARCHIVES=======================You don’t need to install everything included in your THINK Pascal 4.0 package. This list describes which archives you should run to get what you need:      •  Basic THINK Pascal system — “Interfaces & Libs.sea” on THINK Pascal 2,           and copy THINK Pascal 4.0 into your THINK Pascal 4.0 Folder from           THINK Pascal 1.      •  THINK Class Library — “THINK Class Library 1.1.sea” on THINK Pascal 3           and “TCL 1.1 Pascal Demos.sea” on THINK Pascal 2. (Even if you’ve used           the THINK Class Library before, you’ll need the demos for examples of           the new features.)      •  Tutorials and example programs — “THINK Pascal 4.0 Demos.sea” on           THINK Pascal 2.      •  Resource utilities, like ResEdit and SARez — “Resource Utilities.sea” on           THINK Pascal 4.      •  Other utility programs, like Project Utilities — “THINK Pascal           Utilities.sea” on THINK Pascal 1.      •  MacApp 2.0 support — “MacApp 2.0 for THINK Pascal.sea” on THINK           Pascal 3.          The rest of this section describes what’s in each archive.Interfaces & Libs.sea--------------------This archive places these folders in the THINK Pascal 4.0 Folder:      •  DA Shell       •  Interface.Lib      •  Runtime.Lib      •  Interfaces folder      •  Libraries folder, which includes SANELib.lib, SANELib881.lib,           µRuntime.Lib, TCLRuntime.Lib, DRVRRuntime.Lib, and           RSRCRuntime.Lib.THINK Pascal 4.0 Demos.sea-------------------------This archive places these folders in the THINK Pascal 4.0 Demos folder:      •  Hex Dump Folder      •  Hypercard Demos folder       •  LearnOOP folder      •  ObjectDraw ƒ folder THINK Class Library 1.1.sea-------------------------This archive places the THINK Class Library in the THINK Class Library 1.1 folder.TCL 1.1 Pascal Demos.sea-----------------------This archive places these folders in the TCL 1.1 Pascal Demos folder:      •  New Class Demo folder       •  Starter folder       •  TinyEdit folder       •  Art Class Folder Resource Utilities.sea--------------------This archive places these files in the THINK Pascal 4.0 Utilities folder:      •  ResEdit 2.1  folder      •  Rez Utilities folder, which includes SARez, SADeRez, and SAPostRez.THINK Pascal Utilities.sea------------------------This archive places this application in the THINK Pascal 4.0 Folder:      •  Project Utilities It also places these files in the THINK Pascal 4.0 Utilities folder:      •  AppleEdit 2.0, a text editor desk accessory      •  Block Comment FKEY ƒ folderMacApp 2.0 for THINK Pascal.sea-----------------------------This archive places these files in the MacApp 2.0 for THINK Pascal 4.0 folder:      •  Pascal Source Converter       •  Generic.Script       •  MacApp.Script      •  MacApp Seeds folder      •  •Samples from MacApp• folderIt also places the THINK MacApp folder in the THINK Pascal 4.0 Folder, with these files:      •  Diffs folder      •  MacApp Libraries folder      •  Templates folder      •  Settings.R      •  Settings.Debug.RABOUT THE SELF-EXTRACTING ARCHIVES====================================The self-extracting archives included with THINK Pascal 4.0 are created with the shareware program Compact Pro.
