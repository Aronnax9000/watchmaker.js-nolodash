“READ ME” for THINK Pascal==========================Copyright © 1991 Symantec Corporation. All rights reserved.July 23, 1991Font: Geneva 12INTRODUCTION=============This document contains last-minute changes and revisions that aren’t in the THINK Pascal User Manual. The “TCL 1.1 doc“ folder in the “THINK Class Library 1.1” folder contains a READ ME file that describes last-minute changes to the “Object-Oriented Programming” manual.LAST MINUTE CHANGES====================•  This disk contains the file “Installing THINK Pascal,” which tells you how    to set up THINK Pascal on your hard drive. It duplicates Chapter 2,     “Installing THINK Pascal,” in the THINK Pascal User Manual. It’s included     on disk so the people who never read manuals can read it. If the document     contradicts anything in the manual, follow the document. The differences     may reflect minor changes in the layout of the disks.Using MacApp-------------•  You MUST use MacApp 2.01 or 2.02, and you MUST discard your current     THINK MacApp folder and convert your MacApp sources again with the     materials supplied with THINK Pascal 4.0. For more information, see    the Object-Oriented Programming manual, Appendix A, “MacApp and    THINK Pascal.”•  The “MacApp 2.0 for THINK Pascal 4.0” folder contains special versions     of the UFailure library in the “Special Failure Handlers” folder. Use these     libraries if you‘re running a MacApp project under THINK Pascal, and you     need to debug your failure-handling routines. For more information, see     the file “Using the Special Failure Handlers” in the “Special Failure     Handlers” folder.USING SETUPA4 AND RESTOREA4=============================If you write multi-segment drivers, desk accessories, or code resources,make sure that any routine that needs to call SetupA4 and RestoreA4 is inthe same segment as RSRCRuntime.Lib or DRVRRuntime.Lib. USING OBJECT PASCAL IN MULTI-SEGMENT CODE RESOURCES=====================================================If you're using THINK Pascal 4.0 to write code resources with Object Pascal, there are some important details that you should note:     1. In the By Segment view of the Project Window, the <<%_SelProcs>> and          <<%_MethTables>> entries should be together in a different segment          than the main program.     2. In the file that contains Main,  insert the following code before the         main program:          {$S %_MethTables}          {$Push}          {$N-}          procedure LoadMethTables;          begin          end.          {$Pop}          {$S}     3. The beginning of your Main procedure should look something like this:          procedure Main {any optional arguments};          begin               RememberA4;               SetupA4;               LoadMethTables;               {     rest of Main's code     }                    RestoreA4;          end;The important thing here is that you must call LoadMethTables (a routinein the %_MethTables segment), before you use any object-related routines (including New). Otherwise, objects won’t work.
